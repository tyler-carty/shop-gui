# shop-gui

 A more developed version of my shop-cmd that implements a GUI to improve user experience.

 Every function is accessible from a main menu of the GUI, allowing the user free and easy navigation.

 To run, ensure tkinter and random and installed on your python module.

 Then, simply open the .py file in IDLE and run.

 Thank You!
